#### [Vision](Symbolicdata:About "wikilink")

The SymbolicData project is set out to develop concepts and tools for testing Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and to collect relevant data from different areas of Computer Algebra. Tools and data are designed to be used both on a local site for special testing purposes and to manage a central repository at www.symbolicdata.org.

SymbolicData tools and data are available for download under the terms of the **GNU Public License**. Any contribution to SymbolicData presupposes (silently) that you agree (and are allowed) to put your contribution under these terms.

A first couple of releases in 2000-2003 used a special XML-like data format and Perl tools for their management. With the growing importance of Semantic Web applications and the availability of generic tools to create ontologies and to manage XML-based data the focus of the project moved towards a proper presentation of the data in a way that fits such concepts. This transformation is yet on the way.

#### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital benchmark data from various areas of Symbolic Computation together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra.

At the moment the project hosts data from

-   [Polynomial Systems Solving](PolSys "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebra](GAlgebra "wikilink")
-   [Testsets](Testsets "wikilink")
-   [Noncommutative Polynomial Systems](NCPoly "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")
