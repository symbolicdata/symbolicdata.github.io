### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital data for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software from various Symbolic Computation Communities together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special profiling, testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra that can evolve to a digitally supported [Distributed Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink").

### Tools

-   [The SDEval Framework](SDEval "wikilink") developed by Albert Heinle.
-   [The Interface to SageMath](Sage "wikilink") developed by Andreas Nareike.

### Data

At the moment the project hosts data from the following communities within Symbolic Computing

-   [Birkhoff Polytopes](BirkhoffPolytopes "wikilink")
-   [Fano Polytopes](FanoPolytopes "wikilink")
-   [Free Algebras](FreeAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebras](GAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")
-   [Polynomial Systems](PolynomialSystems "wikilink")
-   [Test Sets](TestSets "wikilink")
-   [Transitive Groups](TransitiveGroups "wikilink")

The project manages additional Data:

-   [Annotations](Annotations "wikilink") - a system of background information on different examples and series of examples
-   [Bibliography](Bibliography "wikilink") - bibliographical references system (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Systems](Systems "wikilink") - list of CA systems (aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))

Experimental data (work in progress):

-   [Computeralgebra Databases](CADatabases "wikilink")

### [CASN](CASN "wikilink") - Computer Algebra Social Network

-   [Conferences](Conferences "wikilink") - data bases of upcoming and past conferences
-   Mailing lists [symbolicdata](https://groups.google.com/group/symbolicdata) (news within the SymbolicData project) and [sd-announce](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/sd-announce) (retweet of announcements to reference them in RDF [News](News "wikilink") from the public archive of the list)
-   [News](News "wikilink") - The CA News Channel
-   [People](People "wikilink") - People working in the CA area (mainly extracted from conference announcements and conference reports).
