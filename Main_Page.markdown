The SymbolicData Project Wiki
-----------------------------

### [Vision](Symbolicdata:About "wikilink")

The SymbolicData project is set out

-   to develop concepts and tools for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and
-   to collect and interlink relevant data and activities from different Computer Algebra Communities.

SymbolicData is an

-   *inter-community project* that has its roots in the activities of different Computer Algebra communities and
-   aims at interlinking these activities using *modern Semantic Web concepts*.

Tools and data are designed to be used both

-   on a local site for special testing and profiling purposes
-   and to manage a central repository at www.symbolicdata.org.

SymbolicData tools and data are available for download under the terms of the **GNU Public License**.

-   [Getting Started / What is this all about?](QuickStart "wikilink")

### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital data for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software from various Symbolic Computation Communities together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special profiling, testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra that can evolve to a digitally supported [Distributed Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink").

At the moment the project hosts data from the following communities within Symbolic Computing

-   [Polynomial Systems](PolynomialSystems "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebras](GAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [Test Sets](TestSets "wikilink")
-   [Free Algebras](FreeAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")

The project manages additional Data:

-   [People](People "wikilink") - different people and groups
-   [Bibliography](Bibliography "wikilink") - bibliographical references system (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Systems](Systems "wikilink") - list of CA systems (aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))

Experimental data (work in progress):

-   [Computeralgebra Databases](CADatabases "wikilink")

### Resources

We manage the following resources:

-   This Web site for background information and informal descriptions
    -   A [poster](http://symbolicdata.org/Webseiten/overview-poster.pdf) displays the overall structure and embedding of the project
-   A Google mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/>\#!forum/symbolicdata
-   An official public git Repo at <https://github.com/symbolicdata/symbolicdata>
    -   [More](Using.Git "wikilink") about the way how we use Git
-   Some docu at [readthedocs.org](http://symbolicdata.readthedocs.org).
-   A [SPARQL endpoint](http://symbolicdata.org:8890/sparql) to the RDFData part of the project.
    -   [More](QuickStart "wikilink") about the way how to use Sparql
