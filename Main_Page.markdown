The SymbolicData Project Wiki
-----------------------------

### [Vision](Symbolicdata:About "wikilink")

The SymbolicData project is set out to develop concepts and tools for testing Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and to collect relevant data from different areas of Computer Algebra. Tools and data are designed to be used both on a local site for special testing purposes and to manage a central repository at www.symbolicdata.org. SymbolicData tools and data are available for download under the terms of the **GNU Public License**.

### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital benchmark data from various areas of Symbolic Computation together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra.

At the moment the project hosts data from

-   [Polynomial Systems Solving](PolSys "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebra](GAlgebra "wikilink")
-   [Testsets](Testsets "wikilink")
-   [Noncommutative Polynomial Systems](NCPoly "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")
