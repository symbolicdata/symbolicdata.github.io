The domain symbolicdata.org was accidentally included by GI authorities into a bundle of domains to be released and meanwhile taken over by third party. We asked the authorities to try hardly to get the domain back. For the moment all services are delivered from the base domain symbolicdata.uni-leipzig.de.

### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital data for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software from various Symbolic Computation Communities together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special profiling, testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra that can evolve to a digitally supported [Distributed Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink").

At the moment the project hosts data from the following communities within Symbolic Computing

-   [Fano Polytopes](FanoPolytopes "wikilink")
-   [Free Algebras](FreeAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebras](GAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")
-   [Polynomial Systems](PolynomialSystems "wikilink")
-   [Test Sets](TestSets "wikilink")

The project manages additional Data:

-   [Annotations](Annotations "wikilink") - a system of background information on different examples and series of examples
-   [Bibliography](Bibliography "wikilink") - bibliographical references system (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Conferences](Conferences "wikilink") - data base of upcoming conferences
-   [People](People "wikilink") - different people and groups (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Systems](Systems "wikilink") - list of CA systems (aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))

Experimental data (work in progress):

-   [Computeralgebra Databases](CADatabases "wikilink")
