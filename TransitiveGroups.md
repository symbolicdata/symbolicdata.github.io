### Transitive Groups

#### About

These data refer to classificational data of groups collected in the [Database for Number Fields](http://galoisdb.math.uni-paderborn.de) of Jürgen Klüners & Gunter Malle. This transformation is a very first attempt to compile fingerprints from this collection of transitive groups.

The fingerprints were directly compiled from the corresponding URL in the [Database for Number Fields](http://galoisdb.math.uni-paderborn.de) by **Andreas Nareike** in March 2013.

The transformation code is available from our [maintenance repo](https://github.com/symbolicdata/maintenance).

#### Structure of the Data

-   The Transitive Groups Knowledge Base [for download](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/TransitiveGroups.ttl) and as [Linked Data](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/TransitiveGroups/)
-   The Resources are available directly from the [Database for Number Fields](http://galoisdb.math.uni-paderborn.de).
-   [TransitiveGroups.Ontology](TransitiveGroups.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Transitive Groups Knowledge Base developed so far.
