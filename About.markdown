About the SymbolicData Project
------------------------------

### Vision

The SymbolicData project is set out

-   to develop concepts and tools for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software (CAS),
-   to collect and interlink relevant data and activities from different Computer Algebra Communities using *modern Semantic Web concepts*
-   and to contribute to the process of establishing a [ Global Digital Library of Mathematics]

SymbolicData is an *inter-community project* that has its roots in the activities of different Computer Algebra Communities and thus combines to serve the needs within the *major social frame* of the CA community at large and, together with specialists from the different areas, the special needs of the different CA subcommunities. Most of these needs are of cross cutting nature, hence it is important to concentrate the scarce resources available for infrastructural efforts to develop common concepts and tools.

Tools and data are designed to be used both

-   on a local site for special testing and profiling purposes
-   and to manage a central repository at `symbolicdata.org`.

### [Copyright Issues](Copyrights "wikilink")

To operate a common public data project as SymbolicData requires appropriate Copyright settings. SymbolicData tools and data are available for download under the terms of the **GNU Public License**.

This means that **contributors have to accept those terms** as inavoidable for a contribution. If you contribute to SymbolicData we silently assume that you accept to give an unrevocable nonexclusive right to use your contribution under the terms of the GNU GPL and that you are allowed to grant such rights.

### Main goals

The SymbolicData Project aims at two main goals:

-   to unify efforts to collect digital data for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software from various Symbolic Computation Communities together with concepts, tools and experience for their management both globally and also for special profiling, testing and benchmarking purposes at a local site.
-   to promote a network of repositories of Symbolic Computation digital data and related information from different areas of Computer Algebra that can evolve to a digitally supported [Distributed Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink").

At the moment the project hosts data from the following communities within Symbolic Computing

-   [Fano Polytopes](FanoPolytopes "wikilink")
-   [Free Algebras](FreeAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [G-Algebras](GAlgebras "wikilink")
-   [Geometry Theorem Proving](Geo "wikilink")
-   [Polynomial Systems](PolynomialSystems "wikilink")
-   [Test Sets](TestSets "wikilink")

The project manages additional Data:

-   [Annotations](Annotations "wikilink") - a system of background information on different examples and series of examples
-   [Bibliography](Bibliography "wikilink") - bibliographical references system (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Conferences](Conferences "wikilink") - data base of upcoming conferences
-   [People](People "wikilink") - different people and groups (to be aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))
-   [Systems](Systems "wikilink") - list of CA systems (aligned with [swmath](http://www.swmath.org))

Experimental data (work in progress):

-   [Computeralgebra Databases](CADatabases "wikilink")
