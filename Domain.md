### The domain symbolicdata.org

__This infrastructure was switched off in Nov. 2020.__

The domain symbolicdata.org is central for operating SymbolicData as part of
the [Linked Open Data world](https://lod-cloud.net/).

It serves both
- as URI prefix for the different URIs maintained by SymbolicData and
- as web domain where our public infrastructure is hosted

The domain was sponsored since 2005 by the German Fachgruppe and operated on a
server at Leipzig University during the project's end in 2020.

It operated an Apache web server and a [Virtuoso based RDF
store](LocalSparqlEndpoint "wikilink") and provided
