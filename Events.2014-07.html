<h3 id="july-2014---workshop-on-symbolicdata-and-related-activities-in-leipzig.">30. July 2014 - Workshop on SymbolicData and Related Activities in Leipzig.</h3>
<p>We invited for another Workshop to discuss progress and prospects of the SymbolicData Project and Related Activities. This Workshop was also the final milestone of the work done within the <a href="Projects.EScience" title="wikilink">E-Science Benchmarking Project</a>.</p>
<p>The Workshop took place in room P-702 in the main building (Paulinum) of the Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, 04109 Leipzig.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hans-Gert Gräbe, Simon Johanning (Leipzig, local organization)</li>
<li>Wolfram Sperber, Uwe Schöneberg (Zentralblatt Mathematik Berlin, swMath project)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Since all workshop participants met already six weeks before at the <a href="http://www.cicm-conference.org/2014/cicm.php">CICM-14 Conference</a> in Coimbra (Portugal) there was no need to give an overview on the achievements within the SymbolicData project once more, and we concentrated on a discussion of</p>
<ul>
<li>current advances of SymbolicData within the last two months,</li>
<li>the major development lines within <a href="http://www.mkm-ig.org/">Mathematical Knowledge Management</a> (MKM) and</li>
<li>possible further common efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advances of SymbolicData within the last two months:</p>
<ul>
<li>We extracted more information about people involved with CA from different sources, mainly from the CICM-14 papers and talks and updated the SD People database. It contains upto now 520 foaf:Person entries as a basis for common efforts with the ZBMath towards author disambiguation. Wolfram Sperber and Uwe Schöneberg used ZBMath search facility to find about <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/Data/ZBMathPeople/">340 matching entries</a> within the ZBMath authors database. Another web availability check ruled out 40 of them. Hence there is a reliable alignment of about 60% of the people within the SD database with the ZBMath authors database.</li>
<li>Within the <a href="CASN" title="wikilink">Computer Algebra Social Network</a> (CASN) we report already for a while about upcoming conferences. With CICM-14 as use case we started a discussion about a detailed decentral presentation of the results of past conferences (tracks, chairs, talks, papers; see <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/Uploads/CICM-14.rdf">CICM-14.rdf</a> for the current state of the art) along Linked Data principles and also started to collect more comprehensive <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/casn/ConferenceReports/">Conference Reports</a> within the CASN database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development lines within MKM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolfram Sperber reported about efforts towards a General Digital Mathematical Library (GDML) both at a global and European level. The general impression is that decision meeting people are convinced that a relevant part of the mathematical heritage is digitized, but retrieval of mathematical objects (in particular using appropriately interlinked meta information) is yet at the very beginning. The <a href="https://eudml.org/">European DML Project</a> ended in January 2014, a report on the global situation was published by the American National Research Council in May 2014 and will be discussed at the <a href="http://www.icm2014.org/">ICM 2014</a> in Seoul and also at the <a href="http://dmv.ptm.org.pl/sessions-pdfs/ws-00.pdf">IuK Workshop</a> during the DMV annual 2014 meeting.
<ul>
<li>EUDML makes the mathematics literature published in Europe available online, in the form of an enduring digital collection, developed and maintained by a network of institutions ...</li>

</ul></li>
<li>There are other projects in strong cooperation with ZBMath, in particular the <a href="http://search.mathweb.org/">MathSearch Project</a> and related work of M. Kohlhase and his group.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/">Content MathML 3.1</a> that is compatible to <a href="http://www.openmath.org/">OpenMath</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://trac.kwarc.info/sTeX/">sTeX Project</a> - Semantically enhanced TeX/LaTeX - to embed mathematical semantics into TeX documents.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://planetmath.org/">Planet Math</a> Social Math Network</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Possible future work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide more relational information about papers and software (within the <a href="http://www.swmath.org/">swmath database</a>). For this it would be interesting to evaluate the papers in the <a href="http://msp.org/jsag">Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry</a> under such a perspective. In particular this is a good use case better to understand issues about referring to versions of software.</li>
<li>Present our idea of a Computer Algebra Social Network at the <a href="http://dmv.ptm.org.pl/sessions-pdfs/ws-00.pdf">IuK Workshop</a> during the DMV annual 2014 meeting.</li>
