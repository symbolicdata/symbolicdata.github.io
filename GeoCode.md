### The GeoCode Language

The GeoCode language is a language formally to specify Geometry Proof Schemes in a way that can be used both by drawing engines and geometry provers. It consists of

-   a collection of **sd:GeoCodeFunction** instances collected in the GeoCodeFunctionSpecifications.ttl
-   a notational standard for Proof Schemes given as XSchema GeoProofSchemes.xsd
-   and a collection of Proof Schemes as XMLResources.

To be described in more detail.
