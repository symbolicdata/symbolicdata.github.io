### G-Algebra Ontology

An informal description of the Ontology of the G-Algebra Knowledge Base developed so far.

#### Metadata and Semantics

  
This has yet to be created. HGG - 2013-07-14

All G-Algebra instances belong to the owl:Class **sd:GAlgebra** with predicates

-   sd:relatedXMLResource URI - the Resource file
-   standard predicates sd:createdAt, sd:createdBy, rdfs:comment

The G-Algebra is the factor of the "almost" commutative polynomial rings, i.e. polynomial rings R=k[x\_1,...,x\_n] with commutator relations

  
x\_j\*x\_i=c\_ij\*x\_i\*x\_j+d\_ij for i\<j, c\_ij in k, d\_ij in R, with default c\_ij=1, d\_ij=0 (x\_i and x\_j commute in this case),

by the left(?) ideal generated by the given basis.

For a G-Algebra all polynomials in R can be uniquely rewritten as sum of standard monimials in ordered distributive form, the PoincarÃ© standard form.

The base domain k is a field, either Q or Q(a1,...,ak) for (commuting) parameters a1,...,ak

#### XML-Resources

The XML-Resource contains mainly the following tags

-   (optionally) <parameters> - a list a1,...,ak of (commuting) parameters
-   <vars> - a list x1,...,xn of (almost commuting) variables,
-   <commutators> - a sequence of non trivial commutator rules (only such commutator rules are recorded)

  
  
A commutator rule

  
<commutator fst="y" snd="Dy"> <C>1</D> <D>2\*x</D> </commutator>

represents the rule snd\*fst = C\*fst\*snd + D.

-   <basis> - a sequence of <ncpoly> entries of non commutative polynomials

For details see the XSchema description [GAlgebras.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/GAlgebras.xsd).
