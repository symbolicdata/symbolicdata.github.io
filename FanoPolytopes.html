<h4 id="about">About</h4>
<p>These data refer to polytope classificational data collected within the <a href="http://polymake.org">polymake community</a> mainly by Andreas Paffenholz und Benjamin Lorenz. <a href="http://polymake.org/doku.php/data">Another database</a> interface directly incorporated into the polymake software was develope by Silke Horn.</p>
<p>The polymake project is maintained by Michael Joswig and Ewgenij Gawrilow.</p>
<p>The data for the Fano Polytopes Knowledge Base (Fano Polytope fingerprints, Febr 2016: 8630 instances) is extracted from (some of) the files from <a href="http://polymake.org/polytopes/paffenholz/www/fano.html">Andreas Paffenholz's site</a>. Right now we only extracted the data upto dimension 6, which has mainly two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fano Polytopes Knowledge Base is still in its experimental stage</li>
<li>For higher dimensions, metadata would have to be calculated (it's not in the resource files).</li>
</ul>
<p>For both points (structure and semantics of the knowledge base, calcution of metadata) some more input from the community is needed.</p>
<h4 id="data-extraction">Data Extraction</h4>
<p>We downloaded the compressed polymake files and extracted some information from them. The files of dimensions greater 6 significantly lack data to extract while having a total file size that is much greater (compared to lower dimensions). So right now only dimension 3 to 6 are done to avoid adding huge amount of data with only little meaning.</p>
<p>The Fano Polytope fingerprints were compiled by <strong>Andreas Nareike</strong> in 2013 along the following road map:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once unzipped, each Fano Polytope is given as XML file in <em>polymake</em> format that contains the points that define the Fano Polytope in question. Additionally, some files contain precomputed metadata.</li>
<li>Parsing these files is really straight-forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>The search capabilities of SPARQL queries in these fingerprint data give a first impression of the power of RDF+SPARQL.</p>
<p>The transformation code is available from our <a href="https://github.com/symbolicdata/maintenance">maintenance repo</a>.</p>
