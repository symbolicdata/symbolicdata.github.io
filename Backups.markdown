### The SymbolicData Backup Strategy

#### git Repo

Due to the philosophy of a Distributed VCS as git no measures for backup are required. You may clone immediately the [public repo at github](https://github.com/symbolicdata).

#### Data

#### SymbolicData Wiki XML-Dump

At <http://symbolicdata.org/Backups> you find XML Dumps of our Wiki, that are monthly created with the command 'maintenatce/dumpBackup.php --current'. They can be analyzed with XML tools and also imported into another Mediawiki with the 'importDump.php' command. For details see <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki> (XML dumps)
