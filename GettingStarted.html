<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>This is about how to get startet with the <strong>third version of SymbolicData</strong> that is currently under development.</p>
<p>A <strong>first version</strong> of SymbolicData (SD-1) grew up from efforts in the end of the 1990th. It used modern at that time markup techniques for data (the sd format) and developed a bunch of Perl based tools to transform data from that format for different benchmark tasks. XML as a single eXtensible Markup Language was not yet in common use as today. Most of the data were collected <strong>during the years 1999-2003</strong>. After that time there was not enough manpower to advance the project. The work of that time is available as <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/SD-1.tgz">tar ball</a>.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">raise of XML</a>, in particular after 2004, we decided to give up the special sd format in favour of XML and to develop a <strong>second version</strong> of SymbolicData (SD-2) translating the data to XML. The Perl based tools were outdated and no one was interested to rewrite these tools, since there are plenty of XML tools around in all scripting languages. For the part of tools we concentrated in the following on collecting best practice scripting examples from the contributors. In parallel we tried to involve more people. In particular, the German &quot;Fachgruppe Computerlagebra&quot; adopted the project as their own and sponsors the web domain since those times. During and after the <a href="http://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/specsem/srs/groeb/index.htm">Special Semester on Groebner Bases</a> in March 2006 we tried a relaunch of the project, but with limited success. Nevertheless most of the data were transformed to XML and XSchema standards <strong>during the years 2003-2007</strong>. The work of that time is available as <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/SD-2.tgz">tar ball</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the experience with complex Semantic Web tasks is coined into a whole stack of protocols for different levels of communication. In particular, there is a clear distinction between <strong>Resources</strong> (with XML and XSchema proved useful to describe their data structures) and <strong>Descriptions</strong> (with RDF and OWL as appropriate standards). This is the current direction of development of a <strong>third version</strong> of SymbolicData.</p>
<p>More about how to get started has to be added.</p>
