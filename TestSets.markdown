### Test Sets

#### About

**Test Sets** are examples from Integer Linear Programming and address the cone C of solutions of *A\*x=0* in *N\^n*, where A is a matrix with integer row vectors of length n. The cone depends only on the space generated by the row vectors of A, hence A is given a list of row vectors. The cone C has a uniquely defined minimal generating set, the *Hilbert basis* of C. A (in many examples much smaller) subset generates the real closure of the cone, the *Ray basis*.

There is a close relation to Polynomial Systems Solving via different Toric concepts.
