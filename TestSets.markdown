### Test Sets

#### About

**Test Sets** are examples from computations in affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones. Such a computation yields, e.g., for a rational cone its Hilbert basis and other relevant invariants.

There is a close relation to Polynomial Systems Solving via different Toric concepts.

#### News

-   2015-03-13, HGG - Tim Römer supplied a first version of **More Test Sets** from the Normaliz Database
    -   For the moment this data is integrated as separate draft collection since the format is different from the old Test Sets format.
    -   A transition of the old Test Sets data to the new format by Tim Römer is on the way to present those data in a unified way appropriate for further community support.
-   2014-06-07, HGG - We are discussing to join forces with the Normaliz-Group in Osnabrück (W. Bruns, Tim Römer)

#### Structure of the Data

See

-   the old data [TestSets Knowledge Base](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/TestSets.ttl) and as [Linked Data](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/TestSets/),
-   the new data (draft) [TestSets Knowledge Base](http://symbolicdata.org/Drafts/MoreTestSets.ttl) and as [Linked Data](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/MoreTestSets/),
-   the [XML Resources](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/TestSets) of type [TestSets](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/TestSets.xsd) (old format) in the repository,
-   the [OtherResources](http://symbolicdata.org/OtherResources/TestSets) in Normaliz format (new format) in the repository and
-   [TestSets.Ontology](TestSets.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Free Algebra Knowledge Base developed so far.
