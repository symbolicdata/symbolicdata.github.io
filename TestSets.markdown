### Test Sets

#### About

**Test Sets** are examples from computations in affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones. Such a computation yields, e.g., for a rational cone its Hilbert basis and other relevant invariants.

There is a close relation to Polynomial Systems Solving via different Toric concepts.

#### News

-   2015-04-06, HGG - I moved the Draft/MoreTestSets.ttl to RDFData/TestSets.ttl thus replacing the old Testsets format completely by the new one, removed the old data and uploaded the new data to the RDF store at <http://symbolicdata.org/Data> and removed the old XMLResources/TestSets directory, since it is superseded by the new OtherResources/TestSets data. This has yet to be pulled into the symbolicdata/develop branch.
-   2015-03-23, HGG - Tim Römer translated the old examples from the old to the new Testset format and added corresponding zip-files to the OtherResources/TestSets data base.
-   2015-03-13, HGG - Tim Römer supplied a first version of **More Test Sets** from the Normaliz Database
-   2014-06-07, HGG - We are discussing to join forces with the Normaliz-Group in Osnabrück (W. Bruns, Tim Römer)

#### Structure of the Data

See

-   the (new) data [TestSets Knowledge Base](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/TestSets.ttl) and as [Linked Data](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/TestSets/),
-   the [TestSets Resources](http://symbolicdata.org/OtherResources/TestSets) in Normaliz format (new format) in the repository and
-   [TestSets.Ontology](TestSets.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the (new) Ontology of the TestSets Knowledge Base developed so far.
