<p>Annotations are a generic way to express interrelations between different SymbolicData entries of even different types as an <em>annotated *-ary relation</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, annotations are well suited to express the relation between benchmark data and publications. Create an annotation that points (sd:relatesTo) to the paper and the examples discussed within the paper, and add appropriate textual information as sd:note.</p>
<p>Look for the practices we used so far to create (URI and RDF) labels for such annotations.</p>
<h4 id="ontology">Ontology</h4>
<p>Annotation instances belong to the class <strong>sd:Annotation</strong> with predicates</p>
<ul>
<li>standard predicates rdfs:label, rdfs:comment</li>
<li>sd:note Literal - Main text of the annotation</li>
<li>sd:relatesTo owl:Thing - (multiple) related SymbolicData entries</li>
</ul>
