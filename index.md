# The SymbolicData Project Wiki

## The End

The SymbolicData Project started in 1998 with several ambitious goals is over.
To keep the heritage available for the next generations we transferred most of
the material to this
[github organizational account](https://github.com/symbolicdata) but switched
off the more elaborated RDF infrastructure. This means that several links also
in these wiki pages will no longer work.

You may read in our [News section](New "wikilink") more about the details of
the "last days" of the project, lasting several years.
