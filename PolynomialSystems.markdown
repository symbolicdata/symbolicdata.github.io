### Polynomial Systems and Ideals

#### About

The *Polynomial Systems and Ideals* Data collection contains information about systems of (commutative) polynomials and derived mathematical objects. Polynomial systems are given as XML sequence of polynomials in distributed normal form, complying to syntactical restrictions given in [Types.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Types.xsd) (to be tightened within a quality assurance process), that can be read by a majority of CA systems.

  
The polynomial syntax for variables has to be tightened within a quality assurance process to avoid characters ()[]

#### Structure of the Data

See

-   the [PolynomialSystems](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/PolynomialSystems.ttl) Knowledge Base (as ttl-Download),
-   the XML Resources in the repository with data complying to XSchema definitions [PolynomialSystem.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/PolynomialSystem.xsd), [Common.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Common.xsd) (common structure) and [Types.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Types.xsd) (type definitions)
    -   [IntPS](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/IntPS) (Polynomial Systems with integer coefficients)
    -   and [ModPS](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/ModPS) (Polynomial Systems with modular coefficients)
-   [PolynomialSystems.Ontology](PolynomialSystems.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Polynomial Systems Knowledge Base developed so far.
