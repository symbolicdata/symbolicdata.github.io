### The SDEval Framework

Albert Heinle presented at the [Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") a framework for setting up trusted and repeatable computations that can easily be rerun on a local machine. A python implementation of the framework is available "as is" from the Scripts/python/sdeval directory in the old-master branch of the SD git repo.

For a detailed documentation see the [SD Docu Project](http://symbolicdata.readthedocs.org/en/latest).
