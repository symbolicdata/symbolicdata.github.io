### The SDEval Framework

Albert Heinle presented at the [Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") a framework for setting up trusted and repeatable computations that can easily be rerun on a local machine. A python implementation of the framework is available "as is" from the src/sdeval directory in the [SD git repo](https://github.com/symbolicdata/symbolicdata).

#### What is SDEval

SDEval is a collection of tools that can be used for benchmarking several computer algebra systems on different computation problems given problem instances from the Symbolic Data project.

It can be used to produce executable code for computer algebra systems, even a collection of them, and to run and time measuring them on different machines.

For a detailed documentation see the [SD Docu Project](http://symbolicdata.readthedocs.org/en/latest).
