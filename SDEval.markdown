### The SDEval Framework

Albert Heinle presented at the [Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") a framework for setting up trusted and repeatable computations that can easily be rerun on a local machine. A python implementation of the framework is available "as is" from the src/sdeval directory in the [SD git repo](https://github.com/symbolicdata/symbolicdata).

For a detailed documentation see the [SD Docu Project](http://symbolicdata.readthedocs.org/en/latest).

  
Note that a **new version of SDEval** is to be released soonly. See <https://github.com/ioah86/symbolicdata> for a preview. -- HGG, 2015-02-17
