## Additional material on SymbolicData


This web page continues the [presentation of Hans-Gert Gräbe](Presentations/aca-16.pdf) at the ACA 2016 session on [Information services](Events.2016-08).

### SymbolicData in different stages:
- Version 1 (1999&ndash;2002): 
  - Provide uniform digital open access to research data about Polynomial Systems collected within the PoSSo (1992&ndash;1995) and FRISCO (1996&ndash;1999) EU funded projects. 
    - This are ''resources'' in the RDF terminology and available as [SymbolicData XMLResources](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/)
  - Develop concepts and tools for certified benchmarks on that data.
    - This is nowadays transformed to the [SDEval](SDEval "wikilink") benchmark framework
- Version 2 (2006&ndash;2013): 
  - Transform SymbolicData concepts and data to the evolving [RDF based](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) concepts, standards, protocols, and tools of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/).
  - The main point in this reconceptualization is a clear separation between ''resources'' and ''resource descriptions'' along RDF providing the latter as ''fingerprints'' (metadata) of research data. 
- Version 3 (since 2013): 
  - Provide „fingerprints“ of other collections of CA research data. 
  - Set up an RDF Store with SPARQL Endpoint to query the fingerprints -> [MoreQueries](MoreQueries "wikilink")
  - CA Social Network functionality -> [SymbolicData info page](http://symbolicdata.org/info/)
  - CA People Database
  - Collection of Upcoming and Past Conferences
  - Collection of dissertations in CA (at the moment common effort with the German Fachgruppe only, planned to be aligned with SIGSAM)
  - Experimental alignment with swMATH.
  - Data is used for uniform display within the [web site of the German Fachgruppe](http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/symbolicdata/) (in German).

### What's the scope of such a [Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink")?  

How define the scope of such a network? There are many alternatives:
- Thematically? See a [definition](http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/allgemeines/) (in German) in the CA Handbook (german version 1993, english version published by Springer 2003).
- By the [MSC2010](http://msc2010.org) classification code 68W30? 
- By leading organizations? Activities within the scope of SIGSAM and the German Fachgruppe.
- By people? CA is all about what people ''claim'' to be CA research.

Our current view on CA is that of a research community with several ''subcommunities'' centered around special research topics with ''well established digital research infrastructures''. We try to support interlinking between such subcommunities.  

- Such subcommunities nowadays coincide in many cases with user and developer groups of a common research software project (e.g., [polymake](http://swmath.org/software/724), [gap](http://swmath.org/software/320), [normaliz](http://swmath.org/software/630)).
- Other subcommunities are centered around several research software projects, e.g. the Polynomial Systems subcommunity around [Singular](http://swmath.org/software/866), [Macaulay2](http://swmath.org/software/537), [CoCoA](http://swmath.org/software/143), [FGb](http://swmath.org/software/143), ...

Practically we try to join forces with SIGSAM and the German Fachgruppe.

What's about Zentralblatt, swMATH, ICMS, OpenMath, CICM, WDML etc.? 
- All that is about mathematics at large and hence beyond the scope of our current main efforts within the CASN project. 
- A similar project for mathematics at large requires much more resources and even a different communication concept.
- But, of course, we try to cooperate to the extend of resources available within SymbolicData.
