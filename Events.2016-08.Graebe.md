## Additional material on SymbolicData ##  


This web page continues the [presentation of Hans-Gert Gräbe](http://symbolicdata.org/Presentations/aca-16.pdf) at the ACA 2016 session on [Information services](Events.2016-08).

### SymbolicData in different stages: ###  
- Version 1 (1999&ndash;2002): 
  - Secure uniform digital open access to research data about Polynomial Systems collected within the PoSSo (1992&ndash;1995) and FRISCO (1996&ndash;1999) EU funded projects. 
-  - This are ''resources'' in the RDF terminology and available as [http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/ SymbolicData XMLResources]
  - Develop concepts and tools for certified benchmarks on that data.
-  - Transformed to the [SDEval](SDEval "wikilink") benchmark framework
- Version 2 (2006&ndash;2013): 
  - Transform SymbolicData concepts and data to the evolving [https://www.w3.org/RDF/ RDF based] concepts, standards, protocols, and tools of the [https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ Semantic Web].
-  - The main point in this reconceptualization is a clear separation between ''resources'' and ''resource descriptions'' along the RDF providing the latter as ''fingerprints'' (metadata) of research data. 
- Version 3 (since 2013): 
  - Provide „fingerprints“ of other collections of CA research data. 
  - Set up an RDF Store with SPARQL Endpoint to query the fingerprints -> [MoreQueries](MoreQueries "wikilink")
  - CA Social Network functionality -> [http://symbolicdata.org/info/ SymbolicData info page]
-  - CA People Database
-  - Collection of Upcoming and Past Conferences
-  - Collection of dissertations in CA (at the moment common effort with the German Fachgruppe only, planned to be aligned with SIGSAM)
-  - Experimental alignment with swmath.
-  - Data is used for uniform display within the [http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/symbolicdata/ web site of the German Fachgruppe] (in German).

### What's the scope of such a [Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink")?  ###

How define the scope of such a network? There are many alternatives:
- Thematically? See a [http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/allgemeines/ definition] (in German) in the CA Handbook (german version 1993, english version published by Springer 2003).
- By the [http://msc2010.org MSC2010] classification code 68W30? 
- By leading organizations? Activities within the scope of SIGSAM and the German Fachgruppe.
- By people? CA is all about what people ''claim'' to be CA research.

Our current view on CA is that of a research community with several ''subcommunities'' centered around special research topics with ''well established digital research infrastructures'' and try to support interlinking between such subcommunities.  

- Such subcommunities nowadays coincide in many cases with user and developer groups of a common research software project (e.g., [http://swmath.org/software/724 polymake], [http://swmath.org/software/320 gap], [http://swmath.org/software/630 normaliz]).
- Other subcommunities are centered around several research software projects, e.g. the Polynomial Systems subcommunity around [http://swmath.org/software/866 Singular], [http://swmath.org/software/537 Macaulay2], [http://swmath.org/software/143 CoCoA], [http://swmath.org/software/143 FGb], ...

Practically we try to join forces with SIGSAM and the German Fachgruppe.

What's about Zentralblatt, swmath, ICMS, OpenMath, CICM, WDML etc.? 
- All that is about mathematics at large and hence beyond the scope of our current main efforts within the CASN project. 
- A similar project for mathematics at large requires much more resources and even a different communication concept.
- But, of course, we try to cooperate to the extend of resources available within SymbolicData.
