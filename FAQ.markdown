### Frequently asked Questions about SD

**Question:** Do you provide Linked Open Data in RDF format?

**Answer:** Yes, we

-   operate an [OntoWiki based RDF Store](http://symbolicdata.org/Data),
-   that can be queried by our [SPARQL Endpoint](http://symbolicdata.org:8890/sparql),
-   we provide (not necessarily up to date) consolidated [RDF Data](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData) and also [RDF Draft Data](http://symbolicdata.org/Drafts) in Turtle format for download and
-   operate also a [github master repo](https://github.com/symbolicdata/symbolicdata) managed along our Development Model.

Moreover we operate

-   a second [OntoWiki based RDF Store](http://symbolicdata.org/casn) with
-   separate [SPARQL Endpoint](http://symbolicdata.org:8890/sparql)

that serve the (experimentally yet) [Computer Algebra Social Network](CASN "wikilink")

**Question:** RDF is about *resource descriptions*. What's about resources?

**Answer:** The SymbolicData RDF store links both to

-   [centrally stored resources](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources) in a flat XML syntax (in particular about Polynomial Systems, Free Algebras and G-Algebras) managed by the SymbolicData team itself,
-   to foreign resources in different formats (part of the data collected within the polymake project) and
-   started to [collect resources](http://symbolicdata.org/OtherResources) also in non-XML formats used within the communities.

All that is available for download not only from our web site but also can be cloned form our github master repo.

**Question:** How do you link resources and resource descriptions?

**Answer:** Through *fingerprints*, a concept explained in more detail in our [paper](http://symbolicdata.uni-leipzig.de/Papers/car-55.pdf) in Computeralgebra-Rundbrief 55 (October 2014)
