### Vision

The SymbolicData project is set out

-   to develop concepts and tools for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and
-   to collect and interlink relevant data and activities from different Computer Algebra Communities.

SymbolicData is an

-   *inter-community project* that has its roots in the activities of different Computer Algebra Communities and
-   aims at interlinking these activities using *modern Semantic Web concepts*.

Tools and data are designed to be used both

-   on a local site for special testing and profiling purposes
-   and to manage a central repository at `www.symbolicdata.org`.

SymbolicData tools and data are available for download [under the terms of the **GNU Public License**](Copyrights "wikilink"). Any contribution to SymbolicData presupposes (silently) that you agree (and are allowed) to put your contribution under these terms.

A first couple of releases in 2000-2003 used a special XML-like data format and Perl tools for their management. With the growing importance of Semantic Web applications and the availability of generic tools to create ontologies and to manage XML-based data the focus of the project moved towards a proper presentation of the data in a way that fits such concepts. This transformation is strongly on the way since 2012.
