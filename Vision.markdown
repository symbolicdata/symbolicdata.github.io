### Vision

The SymbolicData project is set out to develop concepts and tools for testing Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and to collect relevant data from different areas of Computer Algebra. Tools and data are designed to be used both on a local site for special testing purposes and to manage a central repository at `www.symbolicdata.org`.

SymbolicData tools and data are available for download [under the terms of the **GNU Public License**](Copyrights "wikilink"). Any contribution to SymbolicData presupposes (silently) that you agree (and are allowed) to put your contribution under these terms.

A first couple of releases in 2000-2003 used a special XML-like data format and Perl tools for their management. With the growing importance of Semantic Web applications and the availability of generic tools to create ontologies and to manage XML-based data the focus of the project moved towards a proper presentation of the data in a way that fits such concepts. This transformation is strongly on the way since 2012.
