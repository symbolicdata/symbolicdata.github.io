### Towards a Computer Algebra Social Network

The vision is a distributed social network within Open Science supporting the needs of the Computer Algebra Community. The social network will be build upon the [DSSN network stack](http://aksw.org/Projects/DSSN.html) developed and implemented by Sebastian Tramp (U Leipzig).

For the moment we collect

-   (meta) informations about new publications (unsing the Dublin Core Ontyology)
-   (meta) informations about current conferences, workshops etc. (using the ical Ontology)

Soonly I will add more information. -- HGG, 20.02.2013
