### Towards a Computer Algebra Social Network

The vision is a digitally supported distributed social network within Open Science for the needs of the Computer Algebra Community.

We plan to build a [first prototype](http://symbolicdata.org/CASN) to technically support such a social network upon the [Xodx implementation](http://aksw.org/Projects/Xodx.html) (Natanael Arndt, U Leipzig) of the [DSSN network stack](http://aksw.org/Projects/DSSN.html) designed and developed by Sebastian Tramp (U Leipzig).

For the moment we collect directly within the SD database

-   [informations about upcoming conferences](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/Tagungsankuendigungen/)
    -   The information is extracted via SPARQL query and [displayed](http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/tagungsankuendigungen/) in the Wordpress based site of the CA Fachgruppe

and plan to collect

-   (meta) informations about new publications (using the Dublin Core Ontology)

There is a project to collect informations about conferences served at a Semantic Mediawiki - <http://openresearch.aksw.org>. HGG, 2013-02-21
