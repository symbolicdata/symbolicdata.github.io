-   (2015-04-06) Tim Römer recompiled also the old TestSets examples according to the new syntax. All stuff from the old format was cleaned up from the repos and the web pages were adjusted.
-   (2015-03-13) Tim Römer (Osnabrück, Normaliz team) provided a consolidated and "fingerprinted" version of the TestSets collection in a new format close related to the Normaliz notation.

-   (2014-10-30) The domain symbolicdata.org was accidentally included by GI authorities into a bundle of domains to be released and meanwhile taken over by third party. We asked the authorities to try hardly to get the domain back.

-   (2014-10-05) We started experimentally a [very first pre alpha presentation](http://symbolicdata.org/info) of our [CASN](CASN "wikilink") Data based on the [angular-js](https://angularjs.org/) framework.

-   (2014-08-01) The [SD people list](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/People/) contains 692 entries of people involved with Computer Algebra. The information was extracted from different sources.
    -   As standard information we provide personal information as instance of foaf:Person with (as subset of) keys foaf:name , foaf:homepage, sd:affiliation (a literal). Due to privacy reasons we do not provide foaf:mbox (email) values. This list is steadily enlarged and used as URI reference for reports about different activities (invited speakers, conference organizers etc.)
    -   2014-08-31: foaf:name standard changed from "lastName, firstName" to "firstName lastName".
    -   2016-02-20: sd:country removed, country is now part of the sd:affiliation literal as "Affil., Country"
-   (2014-08-01) A [first alignment](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/ZBMathPeople/) of the SD people database with the ZBMath author database (348 matchings out of 678 persons).
