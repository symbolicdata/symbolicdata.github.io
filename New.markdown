### What's new?

-   (2014-11-20) symbolicdata.org is again up and running.
-   (2014-10-30) The domain symbolicdata.org was accidentally included by GI authorities into a bundle of domains to be released and meanwhile taken over by third party. We asked the authorities to try hardly to get the domain back.
-   (2014-10-05) We started experimentally a [very first pre alpha presentation](http://symbolicdata.org/info/?s=index.html) of our [CASN](CASN "wikilink") Data based on the [angular-js](https://angularjs.org/) framework.
-   An enlarged list of (692 as of 2014-08-31) [people involved with Computer Algebra](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/People/) extracted from different sources.
    -   As standard information we provide personal information as instance of foaf:Person with (as subset of) keys foaf:name , foaf:homepage, sd:affiliation (a literal), sd:country (as dbpedia URI). Due to privacy reasons we do not provide foaf:mbox (email) values.
    -   This list is steadily enlarged and used as URI reference for reports about different activities (invited speakers, conference organizers etc.)
    -   2014-08-31: foaf:name standard changed from "lastName, firstName" to "firstName lastName".
-   A listing of [upcoming Conferences](http://symbolicdata.org/casn/UpcomingConferences/) with a [brief listing](http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/tagungsankuendigungen/) at the Website of the German CA-Fachgruppe.
-   A first approach to [Detailed Conference Reports](http://symbolicdata.org/Drafts/Conferences/) - one RDF file per conference - with information about the conference organization (venue, web sites, tracks, PC members), the papers, people and talks (in [dcterms](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) notation, author alignment with the SD people database).
    -   The conference paper and talk records are available also as [special RDF graph](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/ConferencePapersAndTalks/) in the SD database.
-   A [first alignment](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/ZBMathPeople/) of the SD people database with the ZBMath author database (348 matchings out of 678 persons as of 2014-08-01).
