### Polynomial Systems Ontology

An informal description of the Ontology of the Knowledge Base of Ideals generated by Polynomial Systems developed so far.

The identifiers within a polynomial system can be interpreted both as variables and as parameters, hence the same polynomial system gives rise to several interpretations as ideals in polynomial rings. Moreover many examples considered in the literature are derived from other ones by homogeneization, quasihomogeneization, homogeneization with respect to subsets of variables etc.

To keep our collection tall different examples are described in the way how they can be generated from other ones.

To navigate within the examples we assume the generating polynomials given in expanded distributive normal form and extracted from that representation (ordered) length lists and (total) degree lists for the given generating polynomials. These values are independent from the variable names used in different sources for the same example and allow to shrink the search space to identify if a given example is already contained in this collection.

All Polynomial Systems instances belong to the owl:Class **sd:INTPS** or **sd:ModPS** that are the rdfs:domain of the predicates

-   standard predicates sd:createdAt, sd:createdBy, rdfs:comment

Get the example

-   sd:createCommand Literal - how to create that example from another one
-   sd:relatedINTPSEntry sd:INTPS - the example addressed by the create command
-   sd:relatedXMLResource URI - the Resource file (if any) containing the basis
-   sd:hasVariables Literal - comma separated list of variables
-   sd:hasParameters Literal - comma separated list of parameters

  
  
The ideal is considered in the polynomial ring Z(parameters)[variables]

Invariants of the generating polynomials

-   sd:hasDegreeList - comma separated list of integers, degrees of the generating polynomials
-   sd:hasLengthsList - comma separated list of integers, number of terms of the generating polynomials

Invariants of the ideal

-   sd:isHomogeneous Literal - integer, 1 if homogeneous (to be changed in type sd:HomogeneousIdeal)
-   sd:hasDegree Literal - integer, degree for a zerodimensional ideal
-   sd:hasDimension Literal - integer, degree for a zerodimensional ideal
-   sd:hasIsolatedPrimesDegrees Literal - comma separated list of integers, degrees of the prime components of a zero dimensional ideal
-   sd:hasIsolatedPrimesDimensions Literal - comma separated list of integers, dimensions of the isolated prime components
