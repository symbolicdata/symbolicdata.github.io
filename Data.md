### The SymbolicData Data Collection

The SymbolicData RDF Data are available through
-   our [OntoWiki based RDF Store](http://symbolicdata.org/Data),
-   can be queried by our [SPARQL Endpoint](http://symbolicdata.org:8890/sparql),
-   are provide for download (not necessarily up to date) consolidated [RDF Data](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData) in Turtle format 
-   from our [github organizational account](https://github.com/symbolicdata) managed along our Development Model.

Those data is a metadata description of the data itself. The data is hosted partly by the project itself as
-  [XML Resources](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources) (polynomial systems, G-algebras and free algebras, GeoProofSchemes)
-  and [other formats](http://symbolicdata.org/OtherResources) (test sets in [normaliz](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/) format).
