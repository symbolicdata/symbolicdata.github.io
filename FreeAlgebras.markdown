### Free Algebras

See the [FreeAlgebra](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/FreeAlgebra) Knowledge Base (link to be fixed), the XML Resources

-   [FreeAlgebra](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/FREEALGEBRA)

in the repository and

-   [FreeAlgebra.Ontology](FreeAlgebra.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Free Algebra Knowledge Base developed so far.

The XML-Resources have to be fixed to fit into the more restrictive syntactical frame of the current distribution.
