### Free Algebras

See

-   the [FreeAlgebra](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/FreeAlgebra) Knowledge Base (link to be fixed),
-   the XML Resources of type [FREEALGEBRA](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/FREEALGEBRA) in the repository and
-   [FreeAlgebra.Ontology](FreeAlgebra.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Free Algebra Knowledge Base developed so far.

The XML-Resources have to be fixed to fit into the more restrictive syntactical frame of the current distribution.
