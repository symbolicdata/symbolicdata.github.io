### Free Algebras

#### About

The *Free Algebras* Data collection contains information about systems of (noncommutative) polynomials interpreted as twosided ideals in a free algebra over the integers. We assume the user to **have semantic aware tools** to work with noncommutative polynomials (that supply input and computation methods). Such tools are not part of the SymbolicData Collection.

**Free Algebras** are given as XML sequence of noncommutative polynomials with integer coefficients in distributive normal form, complying to the syntactical restrictions of *ncpoly* defined in [Types.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Types.xsd). The list of variables is part of the XML record.

  
The ncpoly syntax for variables has to be tightened within a quality assurance process to avoid characters ()[] that are interpreted as function calls -- hgg, 2013-07-05

#### Structure of the Data

-   The [Free Algebras Knowledge Base](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/FreeAlgebra.ttl)

  
  
Currently only as ttl-Download, a [Linked Data access](http://linkeddata.org) is on the way.

-   The XML Resources of type [FreeAlgebra](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/FreeAlgebra) in the repository with data complying to XSchema definitions [FreeAlgebra.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/FreeAlgebra.xsd), [Common.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Common.xsd) (common structure) and [Types.xsd](http://symbolicdata.org/XMLResources/Types.xsd) (type definitions)
-   [FreeAlgebra.Ontology](FreeAlgebra.Ontology "wikilink") - an informal description of the Ontology of the Free Algebra Knowledge Base developed so far.
