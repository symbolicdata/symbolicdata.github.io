### The CASN News Channel

Consult the [CASN Conferences subproject](Conferences "wikilink") for informations about upcoming and past conferences.

The CASN News Channel was designed to annotate information from different mailing lists not concerned with conferences. To get such information archived we installed the [mailing list sd-announce](http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/sd-announce) as a common channel for news within the CA community and use that list in particular for retweets.

Information on this mailing list is annotated within the RDF Graph [News](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/News/) and can be used to feed your own news channel. See [the News Tab](http://symbolicdata.org/info/news.php) at our info page.
