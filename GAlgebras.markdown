### G-Algebras

G-Algebras are "almost" commutative polynomial rings, i.e. polynomial rings k[x\_1,...,x\_n] with commutator relations

  
x\_j\*x\_i=c\_ij\*x\_i\*x\_j+d\_ij for i\<j

with default c\_ij=1, d\_ij=0 (i.e., commuting variables).

For the examples, only the non default values c\_ij, d\_ij are recorded.

The examples have to be fixed syntactically (use a more appropriate notation for the commutator relations, that directly addresses the variable names as indices).
