### 30. July 2014 - Workshop on SymbolicData and Related Activities in Leipzig.

We invited for another Workshop to discuss progress and prospects of the SymbolicData Project and Related Activities. This Workshop was also the final milestone of the work done within the [E-Science Benchmarking Project](Projects.EScience "wikilink").

The Workshop took place in room P-702 in the main building (Paulinum) of the Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, 04109 Leipzig.

### Participants

-   Hans-Gert Gräbe, Simon Johanning (Leipzig, local organization)
-   Wolfram Sperber, Uwe Schöneberg (Zentralblatt Mathematik Berlin, swMath project)

### Results

Since all workshop participants met already six weeks before at the [CICM-14 Conference](http://www.cicm-conference.org/2014/cicm.php) in Coimbra (Portugal) there was no need to give an overview on the achievements within the SymbolicData project once more, and we concentrated on a discussion of

-   current advances of SymbolicData within the last two months,
-   the major development lines within [Mathematical Knowledge Management](http://www.mkm-ig.org/) (MKM) and
-   possible further common efforts.

Advances of SymbolicData within the last two months:

-   We extracted more people involved with CA from different sources, mainly from the CICM-14 papers and talks and updated the SD People database. It contains upto now 520 foaf:Person entries as a basis for common efforts with the ZBMath towards author disambiguation. Wolfram Sperber and Uwe Schöneberg used ZBMath search facility to find about [340 matching entries](http://symbolicdata.org/Data/ZBMathPeople/) within the ZBMath authors database. Another web availability check ruled out 40 of them. Hence there is a reliable alignment of about 60% of the people within the SD database with the ZBMath authors database.
-   SD reports already for a while about upcoming conferences. We started with CICM-14 as use case to discuss about a detailed decentral presentation of the results of past conferences (tracks, chairs, talks, papers; see [CICM-14.rdf](http://symbolicdata.org/Uploads/CICM-14.rdf) for the current state of the art) along Linked Data principles and also started to collect more comprehensive [Conference Reports](http://symbolicdata.org/casn/ConferenceReports/) within the CASN database.
