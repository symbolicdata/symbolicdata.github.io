<p><strong>Security warning:</strong> In the current default installation (as of 2013-11-09, present also in 2014-03-01) the preconfigured <em>Admin</em> account has no password set and the <em>Anonymous</em> account has write access to all ontologies. This should be changed for an non local OntoWiki installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend to create another user account with admin privileges (i.e. declare it as member of the AdminGroup) and remove the original Admin account.</li>
</ul>
