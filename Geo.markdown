### Dynamical Geometry and Geometry Theorem Proving

#### About

Many hard examples in Polynomial Systems Solving originate from problems in Geometry Theorem Proving. We collect examples from that area and try to develop a more geometric language that allows to describe the geometric nature of those examples. During those investigations it turned out that there is a close relation to the description of drawings within Dynamical Geometry Software (DGS).

A huge collection of examples from the famous book of S.C.Chou was supplied by Malte Witte (former student at Univ. Leipzig) in 2001. They are ready for use with the [GeoProver Software](Software.GeoProver "wikilink") but lack compatibility with more general exchange concepts developed in the DGS community in the last years. **A transformation of the examples to such a generalized framework is on the way.**
