### Dynamical Geometry and Geometry Theorem Proving

**A transformation of the examples to such a generalized framework is on the way.**

#### About

Many hard examples in Polynomial Systems Solving originate from problems in Geometry Theorem Proving. We collected examples from that area and tried to develop a more geometric language that allows to describe the geometric nature of those examples. During those investigations it turned out that there is a close relation to the description of drawings within Dynamical Geometry Software (DGS).

A huge collection of examples from the famous book of S.C.Chou was supplied by Malte Witte (former student at Univ. Leipzig) in 2001. They are ready for use with the [GeoProver Software](Software.GeoProver "wikilink") but lack compatibility with more general exchange concepts developed in the DGS community in the last years.

The SymbolicData collection contains

-   [GeometryProblemFormulations.ttl](http://symbolicdata.org/RDFData/GeometryProblemFormulations.ttl) - a knowledge base of **Geometry Problem Formulations** in latex
    -   The URIs are used as references for different proof schemes of these problems
-   GeometryFunctionSpecifications.ttl - the specification of the **[GeoCode](GeoCode "wikilink") language**, a generic language to describe geometry problems, generate drawings and proof schemes
-   GeometryProofSchemes - XML Resources containing formally specified **Proof Schemes** for different problems using the GeoCode language
-   GeometryProofSchemeDatabase - Metadata about relations between problems, proof schemes and other algebraic data
    -   Proof schemes of equational type are related to different problems in SymbolicData [PolynomialSystems](PolynomialSystems "wikilink") part.
