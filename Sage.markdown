### Using Sage for SD Computations

[Sage](http://sagemath.org/) is a free open-source mathematics software system that combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.

The SymbolicData Project provides a [Sage Interface](PolynomialSystems.Sage "wikilink") to the Polynomial Systems collection of our data, developed by Andreas Nareike.
