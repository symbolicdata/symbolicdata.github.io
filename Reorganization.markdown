### Proposal for SymbolicData Reorganization towards an Intercommunity Project

Andreas Nareike presented the SymbolicData Project at the E-Science Workshop in Dresden, see the slides and more about the background at <http://symbolicdata.org/wiki/Publications>, and prepared a poster for the workshop that shows an overall picture of the aims and embedding of the SymbolicData Project, see <http://symbolicdata.org/Webseiten/overview-poster.pdf>.

2) The poster shows our ongoing efforts to place and reshape the SymbolicData Project as an intercommunity project that tries to join efforts within different CA communities to establish a common interlinking infrastructure that extends the intra-community infrastructure in a natural way using modern Semantic Web concepts.

There are several such projects (with different scopes) out there with a similar goal (see the "central cloud" in Andreas' poster) and it is due time better to interconnect these efforts.

We understand that efforts require human efforts in first plan. Hence we propose to ask the communities involved so far with different aspects of the SymbolicData Project to specify people who will care about the needs and issues of that CA community. We think that it would be helpful to coin a name for that new role, and Andreas and me propose "ambassador", "representative" or "agent". I refer to it as XXX in the following. Those XXX people will be the "advisory council" of the SymbolicData Project.

Due to the material collected so far we need XXX for the following parts (I added proposals who this could be):

sdEval (XXX = Albert Heinle) PolynomialSystems (XXX = ?) GAlgebras (XXX = Viktor Levandovskyy) FreeAlgebras (XXX = Viktor Levandovskyy) TestSets (XXX = ?) GeometryProblems (XXX = Hans-Gert Graebe) FanoPolytopes (XXX = ?) InterCommunity (BIB.ttl, People.ttl, Systems.ttl XXX = Andreas Nareike) IntegrationMaster (XXX = Ralf Hemmecke)

3) We remind you the second Workshop on SymbolicData Design in Leipzig 25.-27. July 2013 and ask all people who are interested in the future of the SymbolicData Project to join that meeting. So please send me an e-mail about your plans wrt. that workshop and also ideas, problems and questions that have to be scheduled. More about the workshop and actual information is available from the web page <http://symbolicdata.org/wiki/Events.2013-07>.

Note that Andreas' position ends at end of august 2013 and he will definitely leave the SymbolicData Project towards another Semantic Web Project started by the Saxonian university libraries. He will keep maintaining our technical infrastructure and remain in contact with intracommunity aspects related to his new project (and there are hopefully a lot).

#### Background

During the [December 2012 Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") in Leipzig we decided to refocus the SymbolicData Project to address needs of *communities* within Symbolic Computation to profile, test and benchmark implementations. There is a commonly complained misrecognition of these efforts because such contributions are not in the focus of reputational processes of the respective communities and are rarely proper acknowledged. This is mainly due to the specifics in that area, and SymbolicData will address, collect, offer, ... standards and best practices to change that *across* the different CA communities.

SymbolicData (v.1 and v.2) had its origin within the Polynomial Systems Community, so such a refocussing has to be processed also as a reorganization of data for SymbolicData v.3. A list of communities (at the moment called "areas") with benchmarking activities addressed by SymbolicData will be maintained on the [wiki main page](Main_Page "wikilink"), and there is a process of standardized presentation of community aims on the way.

Andreas Nareike presented the SymbolicData Project at the [June 2013 E-Science Workshop](http://www.escience-sachsen.de/?p=1382) in Dresden, see the slides and more about the background at [Publications](Publications "wikilink"), and prepared a [poster](http://symbolicdata.org/Webseiten/overview-poster.pdf) for the workshop that shows an overall picture of the aims and embedding of the SymbolicData Project as an intercommunity project with strong links to other intercommunity activities as [sagemath](http://sagemath.org/), [lmonade](http://www.lmona.de/), [swmath](http://www.swmath.org/) ond others.
