### Proposal for SymbolicData Reorganization towards an Intercommunity Project

During the [December 2012 Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") in Leipzig we decided to reshape the SymbolicData Project as *intercommunity project*, that address needs of *subcommunities* within Symbolic Computation community to profile, test and benchmark implementations, and has strong links to other intercommunity activities as [sagemath](http://sagemath.org/), [lmonade](http://www.lmona.de/), [swmath](http://www.swmath.org/) ond others, see [Andreas' poster](http://symbolicdata.org/Uploads/overview-poster.pdf) for an overall picture.

But no intercommunity project without vivid roots in the communities. The ongoing efforts of Andreas and [me](User:HGG "wikilink") to place and reshape the SymbolicData Project as an intercommunity project has no value if it is not supported by the subcommunities themselves. SymbolicData can only be successful as *joined efforts within different CA subcommunities* to establish a common interlinking infrastructure that extends and technically supports the intra-community infrastructure in a natural way using modern Semantic Web concepts.

There are several such projects (with different scopes) out there with a similar goal (see the "central cloud" in Andreas' poster) and it is due time better to interconnect these efforts.

We understand that efforts require human resources in the first plan to maintain and manage the resources from different subcommunities. The SymbolicData Project went through several 'dry periods' providing the collected information 'as is' in a read only way as digitally accessible reference. If there were maintainers from subcommunities to bring in their power then parts of SymbolicData matured. For the future it would be helpful to have **coaches** for the different topics on a more regular base that are part of a CA subcommunity and altogether constitute the "advisory council" of the SymbolicData Project.

We need coaches for the following topics (I added proposals who this could be):

-   sdEval (Albert Heinle, no response)
-   (Fano and other) Polytopes (?)
-   GAlgebras (Viktor Levandovskyy, no response)
-   FreeAlgebras (Viktor Levandovskyy, no response)
-   PolynomialSystems (?)
-   TestSets (?)
-   Geometry Problems (Hans-Gert Gräbe)
-   Bibliographical aspects - Bibliography.ttl, People.ttl, Groups.ttl, CAFG, Systems.ttl (Hans-Gert Gräbe)
-   Git Integration Master (Ralf Hemmecke, 50% agreed)

Andreas' position ended in 2013 and he left the SymbolicData Project towards another Semantic Web Project started by the Saxonian university libraries.

#### Background

During the [December 2012 Workshop](Events.2012-12 "wikilink") in Leipzig we decided to refocus the SymbolicData Project to address needs of *communities* within Symbolic Computation to profile, test and benchmark implementations. There is a commonly complained misrecognition of these efforts because such contributions are not in the focus of reputational processes of the respective communities and are rarely proper acknowledged. This is mainly due to the specifics in that area, and SymbolicData will address, collect, offer, ... standards and best practices to change that *across* the different CA communities.

SymbolicData (v.1 and v.2) had its origin within the Polynomial Systems Community, so such a refocussing has to be processed also as a reorganization of data for SymbolicData v.3. A list of communities (at the moment called "areas") with benchmarking activities addressed by SymbolicData will be maintained on the [wiki main page](Main_Page "wikilink"), and there is a process of standardized presentation of community aims on the way.

Andreas Nareike presented the SymbolicData Project at the [June 2013 E-Science Workshop](http://www.escience-sachsen.de/?p=1382) in Dresden, see the slides and more about the background at [Publications](Publications "wikilink"), and prepared a [poster](http://symbolicdata.org/Webseiten/overview-poster.pdf) for the workshop that shows an overall picture of the aims and embedding of the SymbolicData Project as an intercommunity project.
