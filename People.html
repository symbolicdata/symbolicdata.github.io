<h4 id="people">People</h4>
<p>People are modeled as <strong>foaf:Person</strong>. The naming scheme is <familyName_initials> (e.g. Mueller_JH) where <em>name</em> is the full surname, initials are the concatenated initials of the other name parts with a further letter to make the identifier unique, transformed to <a href="Naming" title="wikilink">true ASCII strings</a>.</p>
<p>Predicates:</p>
<ul>
<li>foaf:name Literal: Value is of the form &quot;familyName, givenName&quot;. Used as label.</li>
<li>foaf:homepage URL: Homepage. This is a link to more information about the person in the Linked Data sense.</li>
<li>sd:affiliation Literal. Optional</li>
<li>sd:country dbpedia country URI. Optional</li>
</ul>
<p>The instances of that class cover any person involved with Computeralgebra, in particular authors of papers listed in the SymbolicData <a href="Bibliography" title="wikilink">Bibliography</a> references system. Note that the provided information is not necessarily up to date.</p>
<p>2014-07-13 HGG: foaf:affiliation and foaf:country were renamed to sd:.. since these keys are SD-specific so far. sd:country values were changed to dbpedia country URIs.</p>
<p>2014-06-01 HGG: Person/Dan-Cohen.. and Person/Lange-Hegermann.. changed to Person/DanCohen.. and Person/LangeHegermann..</p>
<p>2014-03-08 HGG: The field foaf:mbox was removed from the public repo due to privacy reasons.</p>
<p>We plan within the <a href="CASN" title="wikilink">CASN</a> extension to offer the people to maintain their own ProfileDocument either within the CA Semantic Network of at another Linked Data aware site of their own choice.</p>
<h4 id="contributions">Contributions</h4>
<p>Contributions to SymbolicData are acknowledged within a knowledge base <em>Contributions.ttl</em>. People involved with SymbolicData have additionally the type <strong>sd:Contributor</strong> with predicates</p>
<ul>
<li>foaf:nick Literal: Nick name within SymbolicData</li>
<li>sd:hasContributed Literal: Record about contributions to SymbolicData</li>
<li>sd:lastModified xsd:date</li>
</ul>
<p>2014-03-08 HGG: This information was separated to its own knowledge base.</p>

<p>This is yet experimental and was moved to a non-public repo due to privacy reasons. We try to shape and sharpen the concepts on the target of German CA Working Groups and Projects within the <a href="http://www.computeralgebra.de/">SPP 1489</a>. Part of the information is available via the <a href="" title="wikilink">CASN|SymbolicData CASN SPARQL endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>The knowledge base <em>CAFG-Intern.ttl</em> contains more detailed information about people. Part of that information is used to display the <a href="http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/fachgruppenleitung/">Board of the German CA-Fachgruppe</a>.</p>
<p>Predicates of foaf:Person</p>
<ul>
<li>foaf:name, foaf:mbox, foaf:phone, foaf:homepage, foaf:familyName, foaf:givenName from the FOAF Ontology</li>
<li>foaf:image URI - a link to a picture of that person within the database of the CA-Fachgruppe</li>
<li>foaf:member foaf:Group - indicates that the person belongs to different groups</li>
</ul>
<p>foaf:Group - used to group people according to different contexts as, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>sdt:FGL2005, sdt:FGL2008, sdt:FGL2011, sdt:FGL2014 - collection of members of the board of the CA-Fachgruppe for the different election periods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The knowledge base <em>Groups.ttl</em> contains informations about German CA Working Groups and (to come up) Projects within the <a href="http://www.computeralgebra.de/">SPP 1489</a>.</p>
<p>CA Working Groups are modeled as <strong>org:Organization</strong>, larger organizational units are modeled as <strong>org:FormalOrganization</strong> (and will be more tightly aligned with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a> knowledge base). For the relations between them we use the predicate <em>org:subOrganizationOf</em>. We use predicates from the skos-Ontology as <a href="http://www.epimorphics.com/public/vocabulary/org.html">recommended by the org ontology standards</a>. There is not yet an established naming scheme, but we use <em>symbolicdata.org/Data/WorkingGroup</em> prefix for CA Working Groups, <em>symbolicdata.org/Data/Project</em> prefix for CA Projects and <em>symbolicdata.org/Data/Organization</em> prefix for formal organizations.</p>
<p>Predicates:</p>
<ul>
<li>skos:prefLabel Literal: the preferred name of the Unit</li>
<li>org:subOrganizationOf org:FormalOrganization</li>
<li>org:hasMember foaf:Person from the People data base</li>
<li>foaf:homepage URL</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the information about groups was extracted from the Web Site of the German CA-Fachgruppe that offered also keywords on the working topics. Those entries have additionally the predicates</p>
<ul>
<li>foaf:topic_interest Literal: Topics of interest (to be switched from Literals to URIs)</li>
<li>sd:hasTag <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/Data/Tag/CAFG-Listing">http://symbolicdata.org/Data/Tag/CAFG-Listing</a></li>
