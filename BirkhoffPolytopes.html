<h4 id="about">About</h4>
<p>These data refer to polytope classificational data collected within the <a href="http://polymake.org">polymake community</a> mainly by Andreas Paffenholz und Benjamin Lorenz. <a href="http://polymake.org/doku.php/data">Another database</a> interface directly incorporated into the polymake software was develope by Silke Horn.</p>
<p>The polymake project is maintained by Michael Joswig and Ewgenij Gawrilow.</p>
<p>The data for the Birkhoff Polytopes Knowledge Base (Birkhoff Polytope fingerprints, Febr 2016: 5399 instances) is extracted from the files from <a href="http://polymake.org/polytopes/paffenholz/www/birkhoff.html">Andreas Paffenholz's site</a>. Note that the collection is only a draft version since for structure and semantics of the knowledge base and calculation of metadata some more input from the community is required.</p>
<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://polymake.org/polytopes/paffenholz/www/birkhoff.html">source</a> consists of seven tables which were compiled into Birkhoff Polytope RDF fingerprints by <strong>Andreas Nareike</strong> in March 2013.</p>
<p>The transformation code is available from our <a href="https://github.com/symbolicdata/maintenance">maintenance repo</a>.</p>
