<p>Consult the <a href="Conferences" title="wikilink">CASN Conferences subproject</a> for informations about upcoming and past conferences.</p>
<p>The CASN News Channel was designed to annotate information from different mailing lists not concerned with conferences. To get such information archived we installed the <a href="http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/sd-announce">mailing list sd-announce</a> as a common channel for news within the CA community and use that list in particular for retweets.</p>
<p>Information on this mailing list is annotated within the RDF Graph <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/Data/News/">News</a> and can be used to feed your own news channel. See <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/info/news.php">the News Tab</a> at our info page.</p>
