### Getting Started

This is about how to get startet with **SymbolicData v. 3**.

-  Some information about the [History of the project](History "wikilink").  
-  [Quick Start to Queries](QuickStart "wikilink")
-  [More Queries](MoreQueries "wikilink")
    
Meanwhile the experience with complex Semantic Web tasks is coined into a whole stack of protocols for different levels of communication. In particular, there is a clear distinction between **Resources** (with XML and XSchema proved useful to describe their data structures) and **Descriptions** (with RDF and OWL as appropriate standards). This is the current direction of development of a **third version** of SymbolicData.

Tools and data are designed to be used both
* on a local site for special testing and profiling purposes
* and to manage our central repository at symbolicdata.org.

To learn more about how the central resources are organized see
* our [poster](http://symbolicdata.org/Uploads/overview-poster.pdf) that displays the overall structure and embedding of the project
* the [Site-Guide](Guide "wikilink") that explains the main ideas behind this wiki and
* the [Infrastructure-Guide](Resources "wikilink") that explains the meaning and location of the resources maintained by our project. 

To use the project locally you have to clone some or all of our different repos:
* [code](https://github.com/symbolicdata/code) The SD code directory
* [data](https://github.com/symbolicdata/data) The SD data store
* [publications](https://github.com/symbolicdata/publications) The SD publications directory
* [web](https://github.com/symbolicdata/web) The SD web examples
