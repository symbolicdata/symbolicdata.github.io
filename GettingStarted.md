### Getting Started

This is about how to get startet with **SymbolicData v. 3** that is currently under development.

-  Some remarks about the [History of the project](History "wikilink").  
  
Meanwhile the experience with complex Semantic Web tasks is coined into a whole stack of protocols for different levels of communication. In particular, there is a clear distinction between **Resources** (with XML and XSchema proved useful to describe their data structures) and **Descriptions** (with RDF and OWL as appropriate standards). This is the current direction of development of a **third version** of SymbolicData.

More about how to get started has to be added.
