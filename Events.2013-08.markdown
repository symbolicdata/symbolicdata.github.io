### 27.-28. August 2013 - Workshop on SymbolicData Design in Leipzig.

We invite for a second Workshop to discuss progress and prospects of the SymbolicData Project and resume the work done within the [E-Science Benchmarking Project](Projects.EScience "wikilink"). Due to little response we decided to shift the workshop to the end of August. Note that we have no financial support for the workshop, hence travel expenses, order and payment of accommodation are to you.

The Workshop will take place in **room P-901** (Paulinum) in the **main building of the Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, 04109 Leipzig**.

For accommodation we recommend the [Seaside Parkhotel](http://www.parkhotelleipzig.de). Please make your own booking.
